I am a student at McGill University in Montreal, currently pursuing a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science. I also hold a first class honours degree in Classics and Contemporary Studies with a minor in the History of Science and Technology from the University of King's College in Halifax, NS. My interests include the practice and philosophy of mathematics, physics and computer science; politics and power; ontology; mythology; and much more.
